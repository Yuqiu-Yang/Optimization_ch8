Introduction to Optimization and Nonlinear Equations 

This beamer presentation mainly focuses on the first half of what's covered in Chapter 8 of the book Numerical Methods of Statistics 2nd Edition by John F. Monahan: univariate root finding and optimization methods including "safe" methods like golden section and bisection, and Newton' Methods using analytical derivatives and numerical derivatives.

We will present how these methods are derived, what their orders of convergence are, as well as what their pros and cons are. 

Finally, we will briefly mention a general guideline for constructing a root finding algorithm and/or an optimization algorithm.
